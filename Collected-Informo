RAON

Recently a new research institute in Korea (ibis) has launched a series of research projects related to igh energy collider.
In search for fusion energy.

There assume to exist more than 20,000 types of isotope atoms in the universe, yet we have only 120 atoms in the periodic table. 
And we know of 2,000 isotope atoms up to now.

The RAON accelerator is hoped by the researchers that it can find 80 % of those existing isotopes.

Our universe is a special case of all possible combination of the universe.
Some other universe may have completely different set of basic materials in their periodic table.
