Design thinking of this new novel, "Perdita Froste"

How much energy do they need to warp into their next stop?

- More than the total energy of Earthling?
   Whole available energy is to be transferred remotely to that aliens. How?
   
- Less than Solar energy?
   A small solar cell can be transmitted to aliens.
   
- Why?

How long does that aliens remain their nearby pluto?

- 3 year?
  within the reach of a certain person
  
- 100 years?
   within our acceptance
   
- 1,000 years?
   longer than human society
   
- why?

Where and how long, in what way do they stay?

- around Pluto

- drifting?

- orbital?

What do they do? Why?

 - debate whether to go into dormant status of the entire ship?
 - or whether to launch a new warp, leaving most of the civilization here.
 
How many individuals do they have? Why?

- 1000 aliens?

- 5 aliens?

- 1,000,000,000 aliens?
  because an entire civilization is drifting/warping around in search of good habitat.
  
In what language do they use? Why?

  - binary language?
    definately, char ghi estas rigardata de universala formo de la komputiko.
  
  - mathematical?
  
When should the aliens be found by human on Earth? And why?

  - Now (2016) because the story must be live and vivid.
  
  - 30 years ago (1990) because we all remember what happened during the last 30 years.
  
  - Hundred years later (2116) because Earthlings already have AI and fusion energy.
  
  - Fifty years later (2070) right after the 'Singularity' where intelligent machines emerge.
  
  - Two thousand years later (3000) - no human being is left anymore, at least, in the present form.
  
Alien, exactly who? and why?

  - protagonist
    - 2 individuals? why?
    - 10 individuals? why?
    - 2 groups? which kind of group? group size?
    - 5 ethnics? do aliens have different ethnics?
    
  - names?
  
    - Thetawa and Alledo, why?
      - only 2 are known, and all the others are unknown to Earthlings.
      
    - why noname? what happens because of this?
    
How to communicate?

 - electro-magnetic pulse?
 - symbiotic message?
 - synchronization?
 - by dream of certain human?
 - English?
 - binary language?
 - or in what media to communicate?
 
 - in human language?
 - how to decode the message?
 - how to aknowledge the transmission of message to the remote counter-part?
 
 - in what frequency does the communication happen? and why?
 
Why aliens debate?
 
 - owing to lack of energy
 
 - how much/less do they have energy?
 
 - how much for a single transprtational need?
 - should it be sufficient only to transmit signals?
 
 - why hesitate? because humans doesn't understand, yet. or because that exhausts their remaining energy.
 
 - how much energy is needed for that?
 
Lack of energy? How much is that?

 - more than human capacity?
   if aliens are very heavy and cold matter/material?
   
 - less than human salvation?
   if aliens are very light, light as light wave.
   
How humans find them?

 - they are dark, heavy, invisible.
 - just measuring the gravitational distortion, humans can 'guess' the existence of the aliens.
 
Actual meeting between human and alien civilization should not happen, why?

 - because it's too dangerous for both of them.
 - each other are pollar opposite of each othern, resulting to a total collapse.
 
How the story ends? and Why?

 - aliens disappears, suddenly - warp leap to somewhere else toward outer galaxy all at once.
 - remains only a big bright light flash
   or a screaming sound?
   or gravitational wave shock?
   
Why they disappear?

  - they thought the earth is too strange, not appropriate for their habitation
  - they need much bigger planet, with much less gravity, much warmer than Sun, for lasting energy.
  
What form of help, did earthlings give to the aliens?

  - solar panel?
  - laser beam?
  - large accelerator? minimized one? how to tranport it to that place (around Pluto)?
  - sound wave?
  - just songs of certain rhythm?
  - why?
