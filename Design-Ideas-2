Design thinking of my new novel 'Perdita Froste'.

How the Earthlings get to know the necessity of the aliens?

 - in someone's dream, prophecy?
 - in the defense of themselfves (Earthings)?
 - in radio transmission or signals from the dark aliens in binary language?
 - how to recognize the signal?
 
How to recognize the signal?

 - differentiate the noise from artifacts, by entropy difference
 - entropy, special case of the noise.
 

What does Earthlings learn? and why?

 - Existence of certain universe with different set of physical parameter.
 - skills to better wield the lights and energy
 - solving fusion problem
 - or what?
 
Who among earthlings? and why?

 - a physician?
 - a computer hacker?
 - a hip hop star?
 - just jerk? a digital dancer? choriography?
   dacing sequence codified in signal?
 - bit sequence of solved block chain from aliens
   wheel of fortune
   
   
Earthlings? Motivation? 
 - Safety? Security? Food? Shelter? fresh clean place? air/water?
 - Social bond?
 - in seek of social pleasure
  - gathering likes, fame, reknown nomination, popularity
  - all forms of social bond
 - 

Democritized Media, and how it is relevant to the story?

 - no more facebook -> because everybody shares everything via P2p way, block chain
 - mass destruction (heavy arms) doesn't harm human race anymore
   because we can survive through P2P way of existence
   
Block chain costs lots of energy!

 - that's why energy crisis becan in the middle of 21st centry.
 - special form of sociaty evolved around democritized P2P way of information revolution
 
Speical forms of P2P/bitcoin emerged and gave a firm foundation to the whole society.

Aliens are the souce of rare resouce. not minerals but numbers. wheel of fortune.

Why aliens emit the numbers?

 - they have gathered a lot of them, already, with limitless computing power.
 - tests as an evidence of higher level of intelligence.

Why those numbers matter?

 - because that helps findings of special condition of fusion sensibility for unlimited energy 
 - physics relys on math, in this special case.
 
Why nationality of the computer hackers?

 - Cologolese african?
 - Korean asian?
 - Vietnamese living in Israel?
 
Why certain form of music is popular & and while others not?

 - those are all the numbers of blockchain solution.
 - mathematical numbers count
 
From whose viewpoint? Whose narratives?

 - a friend of that hacker? / physician? / dancer? / choriographer? / musician?
 
 - a father to a son who don't unerstand much, why?
 

How does the story begins?

 - Congolese boy recording Korean dancer movement in alphabet codes, and saves it to his tablet.
 - a group of hackers stoles his files with a bunch of sequence of strings, which turned out to be codes, numbers of fortunens.
   
 - The russian hackers chases down that Congolese boy who are just collecting Korean dances, video clips and wanted to visit Korea.
 - Some international investigation has reached the russian/hungarian hackers but they just don't know what was happening. 
   None of them.
   
Chinese austronaut just installed a basecamp on outer surface of the moon, the dark side of the moon.
  - so that he can observe outer space better, without distraction of light from earth.
  - the austronaut observes planets one by one, mars, jupiter, unanus, and near by pluto
    he found a very subtle distortion of gravitation.
    certain existence of something. yet, dark and unable to see.
    
  - sets off an investigation by a group of chinese scientists.
  - he found that a small hints of numerical pulse, artificial (artifacts), from that dark dot.
  
Those are small part of whole lots of signals, emitted out of that tiny black dot.
  - and his signals, stored in his laptop have been stolen by the same hackers.
  
The energy consumptions by the bit-miners are regulated by the authority, globally because hey consume too much of energy only for finding bit  patterns.

Bit patterns now become so invaluable and even the new findings of bit coins become a world news.

All of a sudden several bit sequences are found by a group of hackers, with no substantial energy consumption,
which caused a systematic investigation by the crime investigators.

How girls/women play their role? and why?

bit sequence from the alien. but what can be transmitted from earth to the aliens?

Unidirectional communication can be sufficient? How?
