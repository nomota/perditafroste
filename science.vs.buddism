Buddhist way of thinking similars to modern science in many ways.
But what's the difference after all?

The difference is the capabiltiy of precise predition.
Both say the incompleteness and uncertainty of the world.

But one can predict certain event within certain level of confidence, and the other cannot.
That's the value of modern science.
